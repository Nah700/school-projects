## Overview

Welcome to my collection of academic projects completed during my second and third years at Epitech. This repository offers a curated selection of projects that demonstrate my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and growth as a software developer.

## Project Selection Criteria

Not all projects are included in this repository. I have carefully selected and uploaded those that best showcase my technical capabilities, innovative approaches, and the breadth of my programming experience.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two primary directories:
- `2nd-year/`: Projects completed during my second year
- `3rd-year/`: Projects completed during my third year

Each project directory contains:
- Source code
- Documentation
